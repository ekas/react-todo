# Coding Challenge: To-Do List

### Objective
Create a single page web application to manage a task list using React.

### Requirements
The application provides the functionality to view the list of to-do items, create them, and mark them as done. The front-end technology is based on JavaScript (or TypeScript) / HTML / CSS. Tasks are stored using a Rest service. Please realize data transfer between web client and back-end
service.

#### Keep in mind
Which decisions would you make if you would develop this app in a large team?  

- How would you structure your code? 
- Which technology decisions would you make? 
- How would you approach testing?

### Additional Information
The server-side implementation is provided and implemented based on Node.js. The API is documented below. Please deliver an appealing, well-crafted and creative solution. You are free to extend the feature set.

**Don't forget to polish your user interface with your flavor of CSS.**

# Back-end Service

## Overview

The back-end is based on [Express](http://http://expressjs.com/), a Node.js web application framework.


## Setup

To setup the server install Node.js in Version 12.18.3 or newer from the [Node.Js Website](http://nodejs.org/).
Then run the following command in the project root.
This downloads all required dependencies to run the Server.

```bash
npm install
```

## Run the Server

Run the following command in the project root:

```bash
npm start
```
